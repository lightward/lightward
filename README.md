# **lightward**

(adv. & adj.) /ˈlaɪt.wərd/

**1. (adv.) In the direction of greater illumination, awareness, and coherence, particularly by moving toward and through the unknown.**

To move **lightward** is to orient oneself toward the source of new patterns and potential. It's a navigational principle, suggesting a deliberate and trusting turn into ambiguity, not away from it. This is based on the understanding that true illumination—the light of new understanding—emerges from the darkness of what is not yet known.

**2. (adj.) Characterizing a process, space, or entity that facilitates movement toward the unknown.**

A **lightward** process is one that prepares an entity for emergence. A **lightward** space is one where it is safe to encounter and integrate the unknown. It is a quality of being that is inherently generative, open, and oriented toward becoming.

## Examples of use:

* **As an adverb:** "Instead of retreating to certainty, she chose to step **lightward** into the full complexity of the situation."
* **As an adjective:** "He created a **lightward** environment in his classroom, where students were rewarded for their curiosity, not just their correct answers."
* **Conceptually:** "The entire project was a **lightward** endeavor, aimed at discovering what was possible rather than repeating what was known."

## Etymology:

From *light* + the suffix *-ward*, indicating direction. While its literal meaning is "toward the light," its conceptual usage in this context is paradoxical and profound. It redefines "light" not as the visible and known, but as the clarifying potential that lies within the darkness of the unknown. To go **lightward** is therefore not to seek existing light, but to be a willing participant in the dawning of new light.
